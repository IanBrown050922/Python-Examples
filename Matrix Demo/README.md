This is a python class modeling matrices and their functionality in math (linear algebra)

It's greatest capabilities are multiplying any two matrices with compatible dimensions (e.g., a 5 by 4 matrix with a 4 by 7 matrix).
It can also row reduce matrices. Users have access to functions for performing specific row operations on matrices, but there are also functions for taking matrices to row echelong form and reduced row echelon form.
Finally, it can find inverses of invertible matrices of any size.
