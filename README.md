# Python-Examples

This is a python class that models matrices in linear algebra.

It's greatest features are the capability of multiplying together matrices of any compatible dimensions (for example, a 3 by 5 matrix with a 5 by 6 matrix).
It is also capable of row reducing matrices of any dimension: taking them to row echelon form or reduced row echelon form, thus it can be used to solve systems of linear equations.
Finally, it can find the inverse of an invertable matrix

more will be added.
